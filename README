Simply type "make" to make the necessary files.
Note that ghc compilation may fail if the packages required by HaPy.hs have not been compiled with dynamic linking enabled.
If this happens, simply reinstall the relevant package with the command "cabal install --reinstall --enable-shared <package>"

Once everything has been built, make a nice Haskell module. Call it Module. Fire up a Python interpreter (or open up a Python script) and type "from HaPy import Module"
Now you should be able to call functions defined in module just by typing "Module.functionName(args)" as you would an ordinary Python function.
